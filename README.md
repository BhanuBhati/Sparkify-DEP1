# Sparkify Database Schema and ETL Pipeline Developement

## Introduction

A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

They'd like a data engineer to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis, and bring you on the project. Our role is to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis.

## The Datasets

### Song Dataset

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. 
For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.
    
    song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
    song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

    {"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}

### Log Dataset

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

    log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
    log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

## Schema Details

We are going to create a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables: 

### Fact Table

1. **songplays** - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page *NextSong*
    - songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent

### Dimension Tables

2. **users** - users in the app
    - user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level
3. **songs** - songs in music database
    - song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration
4. **artists** - artists in music database
    - artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude
5. **time** - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
    - start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday


## Project Files

The project directory contains all the data files in data folder. In addition to data files, the project workspace includes 6 files:

1. **test.ipynb** displays the first few rows of each table to let you check your database. (for development purpose only)
2. **create_tables.py** drops and creates your tables. You run this file to reset your tables before each time you run your ETL scripts. (for development purpose only)
3. **etl.ipynb** reads and processes a single file from song_data and log_data and loads the data into your tables. This notebook contains detailed instructions on the ETL process for each of the tables.
4. **etl.py** reads and processes files from song_data and log_data and loads them into your tables. You can fill this out based on your work in the ETL notebook.
5. **sql_queries.py** contains all your sql queries, and is imported into the last three files above.
6. **README.md** provides discussion on your project.
  


# ETL Process

## Process Song Data

### 1. Songs Table

#### Extract Data for Songs Table
- Load each json file in `/data/song_data` with pandas dataframe with typ='series'

        pd.read_json(filepath, typ='series')


- Select columns for song ID, title, artist ID, year, and duration
- Use `df.values` to select just the values from the dataframe
- Index to select the first (only) record in the dataframe
- Convert the array to a list and set it to `song_data`

#### Insert Record into Song Table
Implement the `song_table_insert` query in `sql_queries.py` and run the cell below to insert a record for this song into the `songs` table. Remember to run `create_tables.py` before running the cell below to ensure you've created/resetted the `songs` table in the sparkify database.

### #2. Artists Table

#### Extract Data for Artists Table
- Using same dataframe we filled with read_json for songs table.
- Select columns for artist ID, name, location, latitude, and longitude
- Use `df.values` to select just the values from the dataframe
- Index to select the first (only) record in the dataframe
- Convert the array to a list and set it to `artist_data`

#### Insert Record into Artist Table
Implement the `artist_table_insert` query in `sql_queries.py` and run the cell below to insert a record for this song's artist into the `artists` table. Remember to run `create_tables.py` before running the cell below to ensure you've created/resetted the `artists` table in the sparkify database.
  
  
#### We now have songs and artist tables.

## Process Log Data

In this part, we are performing ETL on the second dataset, `log_data`, to create the `time` and `users` dimensional tables, as well as the `songplays` fact table.

Load each json file in `/data/log_data` with pandas dataframe with lines=True
    
        df = pd.read_json(filepath, lines=True)

### 1. Time Table

#### Extract Data for Time Table
- Filter records by `NextSong` action
- Convert the `ts` timestamp column to datetime

        pd.to_datetime(df['ts'], unit = 'ms')

- Extract the timestamp, hour, day, week of year, month, year, and weekday from the `ts` column and set `time_data` to a list containing these values in order
- Specify labels for these columns and set to `column_labels`
- Create a dataframe, `time_df,` containing the time data for this file by combining `column_labels` and `time_data` into a dictionary and converting this into a dataframe

        time_data = dict(zip(column_labels, time_data))

#### Insert Records into Time Table
Implementing the `time_table_insert` query in `sql_queries.py` inserting records for the timestamps in the log file into the `time` table using executemany().

### 2. Users Table

#### Extract Data for Users Table
- Select columns for user ID, first name, last name, gender and level and set to `user_df`

#### Insert Records into Users Table
Implementing the `user_table_insert` query in `sql_queries.py` inserting records for the users in this log file into the `users` table using executemany().

### 3. Songplays Table
#### Extract Data and Songplays Table
This one is a little more complicated since information from the songs table, artists table, and original log file are all needed for the `songplays` table. Since the log file does not specify an ID for either the song or the artist, we need to get the song ID and artist ID by querying the songs and artists tables to find matches based on song title, artist name, and song duration time.
- Implementing the `song_select` query in `sql_queries.py` to find the song ID and artist ID based on the title, artist name, and duration of a song.
- Selecting the timestamp, user ID, level, song ID, artist ID, session ID, location, and user agent and set to `songplay_data`

#### Insert Records into Songplays Table
- Implementing the `songplay_table_insert` query and inserting records for the songplay actions in the log file into the `songplays` table. 

#### We now have time, users and songplay tables as well.
